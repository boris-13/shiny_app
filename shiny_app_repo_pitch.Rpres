Course Project
========================================================
- This is the final presentation for the Course Project
- The course is focused on Developing Data Products
- The main objective of the project is to write a Shiny application

This was built as part of a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The app developed for the first part of the assignment demo is avalilable at:
<http://rpubs.com/boris13/shiny_app/>.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub repo: <https://github.com/boris-13/shiny_app/>.

Embeded Code in the Slide
========================================================
- The following code calculates <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkblue;">mpg</span> prediction on given <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkblue;">weight</span> based on minimal linear regression model 
- The output shows the predicted <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkblue;">mpg</span> value and the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval
```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(wt = 3.45), interval="confidence")
```
Moto Trend Shiny Application: Dataset
========================================================
- For this assignment, we used the mtcars dataset.
- The data was extracted from the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:darkblue;">1974 Motor Trend US</span> magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
- Some information about the dataset:

```{r}
head(mtcars[,1:5])
```

Plot MPG vs Displacement (mtcars dataset)
========================================================
- mpg~disp plot
- lm regression line
- loess regression line
